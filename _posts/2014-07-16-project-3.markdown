description: Using RecyclerViews and Singleton classes, this app provides an intuitive and seamless way for users to trak items, tasks and challenges. Each activity displays the data in a custom RecyclerView. Data can be added, editted or deleted from the Singleton class. This was my first project in General Assembly's Android Development Immersive Bootcamp.
