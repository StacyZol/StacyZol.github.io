description: Using New York Times API, I created a news media platform for users to read recent and topical news articles, favorite and share articles, and subscribe to topics. I built this with a team of 2 others. JSON data from the APIs are parsed using Gson and Retrofit through an AsyncTask. An AsyncTask is also used to push notifications on news updates. The interface features a TabLayout housing fragments and each news article is displayed on a customized cards fitted onto a RecyclerView.
