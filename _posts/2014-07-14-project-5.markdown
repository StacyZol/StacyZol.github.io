description: Using Databaseâ€™s, Recycler Views, Singletons and Fragments, this app is a shopping platform designed to allow users to browse through a list of nurseries by location, browsing and searching within each nursery for items, and add them to a shopping cart and/or their favorites. The items are stored in a SQLite database and the favorites and shopping cart are stored in a Singleton. The shopping cart is accessible throughout the entire app and items can be added from an alert dialog where the item's description is also displayed. This app has a dynamic search and various material design elements that guides the user to a smooth purchase.
