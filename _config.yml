description: "I'm a thinker and a doer - I come up with solutions to problems (and sometimes solve for problems that don't even exist).  Because I'm curious by nature and ask a lot of questions, I've mastered the art of Googling which has made me an expert of on a variety of topics like eCommerce, foreign affairs and more recently, Android Development. 

I'm fluent in Italian and Russian, have travelled over the world and have extensive knowledge in foreign affairs, international relations, human intelligence, world economics, diplomacy and humanitarian aid.  

Some of my personal hobbies include: riding motorcycles, scuba diving, producing music, running marathons, traveling and coming up with entrepreneurial, world-changing ideas."
